### The Data Science Process

**Problem Statement**

The All-NBA Team selection is one of the most prestigious accolades in the NBA, recognizing the league's top players each season. Being named to an All-NBA Team can significantly impact a player's career, influencing their legacy, contract negotiations, and marketability. It can also heavily influence the trade market and how a general manager constructs a team. However, predicting which players will be selected for the All-NBA Teams is a complex task that involves analyzing a variety of performance metrics, player attributes, and team dynamics. The objective of this capstone project is to develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts the players who will be selected to the All-NBA Teams at the end of the season. This model will utilize player statistics, team performance, and historical data to make informed predictions.
